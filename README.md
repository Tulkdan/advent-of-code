# Advent of Code Challenges

This repo serves to train Rust with the [Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2021) that take place on December of each year.

I'm creating each branch for each year so you can navigate for each year that I participated.
The main branch serves only as a template.

Each challenge will have it's own file and unit tests to validate the challenge, also,
every challenge has an input file with data, that I'm storing on `input/` folder.
